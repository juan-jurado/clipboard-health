# Refactoring

You've been asked to refactor the function `deterministicPartitionKey` in [`dpk.js`](dpk.js) to make it easier to read and understand without changing its functionality. For this task, you should:

1. Write unit tests to cover the existing functionality and ensure that your refactor doesn't break it. We typically use `jest`, but if you have another library you prefer, feel free to use it.
2. Refactor the function to be as "clean" and "readable" as possible. There are many valid ways to define those words - use your own personal definitions, but be prepared to defend them. Note that we do like to use the latest JS language features when applicable.
3. Write up a brief (~1 paragraph) explanation of why you made the choices you did and why specifically your version is more "readable" than the original.

You will be graded on the exhaustiveness and quality of your unit tests, the depth of your refactor, and the level of insight into your thought process provided by the written explanation.

## Your Explanation Here

In my refactored code, I made a few changes to improve readability while preserving the original functionality. First, I moved the initialization of the `candidate` variable to the top for better readability. I also removed an unnecessary level of nesting by removing the `else` statement for the first `if`. Additionally, I simplified the conditional for checking the length of `candidate` by moving it to the bottom and not checking for truthiness since the `TRIVIAL_PARTITION_KEY` is already defined. Finally, I simplified the `crypto.createHash` call by using the same hash algorithm for both cases.

Overall, my version is more readable than the original because it removes unnecessary complexity and nesting, uses consistent and simplified logic throughout the function, and follows a more logical flow from top to bottom. This makes it easier to understand the function's purpose and behavior at a glance, and makes it easier to maintain and modify in the future.

Next, you can follow the changes written in steps.

1. Moved the initialization of the `candidate` variable to the top for better readability.
2. Removed an unnecessary level of nesting by removing the `else` statement for the first `if`.
3. Removed the extra check for `candidate` to be truthy before checking if it's a string since `JSON.stringify` will handle this case and it will always be truthy if it's not `null` or `undefined`.
4. Simplified the conditional for checking the length of `candidate` by moving it to the bottom and not checking for truthiness since the `TRIVIAL_PARTITION_KEY` is already defined.
5. Simplified the `crypto.createHash` call by using the same hash algorithm for both cases.

# Tests
This tests the existing functionality of the `deterministicPartitionKey` function and ensures that the refactored code still produces the same results. You can run these tests using the `jest` command in the terminal after installing it as a dev dependency using `npm install jest --save-dev`.
